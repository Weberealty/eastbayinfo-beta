                        <section>The reasons behind your decision to sell affect everything from setting a
                        price to deciding how much time and money to invest in getting your home ready
                        for sale. What's more important to you: the money you walk away with, or the
                        length of time your property is on the market? Different goals will dictate
                        different strategies. 
                        </section>
                        <section>However, don't reveal your motivation to anyone else or they may use it
                        against you at the negotiating table. When asked, simply say that your housing
                        needs have changed.
                        </section>
                        <section><h2>2. Do your homework before setting a price.</h2></section>
                        <section>Settling on an offering price shouldn't be done lightly. Once you've set
                        your price, you've told buyers the absolute maximum they have to pay for your
                        home, but pricing too high is as dangerous as pricing&nbsp;too low. Remember that the
                        average buyer is looking at 15-20 homes at the same time they are considering
                        yours. This means that they have a basis of comparison, and if your home doesn't
                        compare favorably with others in the price&nbsp;range you've set, you won't be
                        taken seriously by prospects or agents. As a result, your home will sit on the
                        market for a long time and, knowing this, new buyers on the market will think
                        there must be something wrong with your home.
                        </section>
                        <section><h2>3. Do your homework.</h2></section>
                        <section>(In fact, your agent should do this for you). Find out what homes in your own
                        and similar neighborhoods have sold for in the past 6-12 months, and research
                        what current homes are listed for. That's certainly how prospective buyers
                        will assess the worth of your home.
                        </section>
                        <section><h2>4. Find a good real estate agent&nbsp;to represent your needs.</h2></section>
                        <section>Nearly three-quarters of homeowners claim that they wouldn't use the same
                        realtor who sold their last home. Dissatisfaction boils down to poor
                        communication which results in not enough feedback, lower pricing&nbsp;and strained
                        relations. Another FREE report entitled, &quot;10 Questions to Ask Before You Hire

                        <section><h2>5. Maximize your home's sales potential.</h2></section>
                        <section>Each year, corporate North America spends billions on product and packaging
                        design. Appearance is critical, and it would be foolish to ignore this when
                        selling your home.
                        </section>
                        <section>You may not be able to change your home's location or floor plan, but you
                        can do a lot to improve its appearance. The look and feel of your home generates
                        a greater emotional response than any other factor. Clean like you've never
                        cleaned before. Pick up, straighten, unclutter, scrub, scour and dust. Fix
                        everything, no matter how insignificant it may appear. Present your home to get
                        a &quot;wow&quot; response from prospective buyers.
                        </section>
                        <section>Allow the buyers to imagine themselves living in your home. The decision to
                        buy a home is based on emotion, not logic. Prospective buyers want to try on
                        your home just like they would a new suit of clothes. If you follow them around
                        pointing out improvements or if your decor is so different that it's difficult
                        for a buyer&nbsp;to strip it away in his or her mind, you make it difficult for them
                        to feel comfortable enough to imagine themselves an owner. 
                        </section>
                        <section><h2>6. Make it easy for prospects to get information on your home.</h2></section>
                        <section>You may be surprised to know that some marketing tools that most agents use
                        to sell homes (e.g. traditional open houses) are actually not very effective. In
                        fact only 1% of homes are sold at an open house.
                        </section>
                        <section>Furthermore, the prospects calling for information on your home probably
                        value their time as much as you do. The last thing they want to be subjected to
                        is either a game of telephone tag with an agent, or an unwanted sales pitch.
                        Make sure the ads your agent&nbsp;places for your home are attached to a 24 hour
                        prerecorded hotline with a specific ID# for your home which gives buyers access
                        to detailed information about your property day or night 7 days a week without
                        having to talk to anyone. It's been proven that 3 times as many buyers call
                        for information on your home under this system. And remember, the more buyers
                        you have competing for your home the better, because it sets up an auction-like
                        atmosphere that puts you in the driver's seat. 
                        </section>
                        <section><h2>7. Know your buyer.</h2></section>
                        <section>In the negotiation process, your objective is to control the pace and set the
                        duration. What is your buyer's motivation? Does s/he need to move quickly?
                        Does s/he have enough money to pay you your asking price? Knowing this
                        information gives you the upper hand in the negotiation because you know how far
                        you can push to get what you want.

                        <section>For your part as a seller, make sure you disclose everything. Smart sellers
                        proactively go above and beyond the laws to disclose all known defects to their
                        buyers in writing. If the buyer&nbsp;knows about a problem, s/he can't come back
                        with a lawsuit later on.

                        <section>Make sure all terms, costs and responsibilities are spelled out in the
                        contract of sale, and resist the temptation to diverge from the contract. For
                        example, if the buyer&nbsp;requests a move-in prior to closing, just say no. Now is
                        not the time to take any chances of the deal falling through.

                        <section>Studies have shown that it is more difficult to sell a home that is vacant
                        because it looks forlorn, forgotten, simply not appealing. It could even cost
                        you thousands. If you move, you're also telling buyers that you have a new
                        home and are probably highly motivated to sell fast. This, of course, will give
                        them the advantage at the negotiating&nbsp;table.
