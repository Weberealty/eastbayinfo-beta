                        <section><h3>1. Bidding Blind</h3></section>
                        <section>What price should you offer&nbsp;when you bid on a home? Is the seller's asking
                        price too high, or does it represent a great deal. If you fail to research the
                        market in order to understand what comparable homes are selling for, making your
                        offer would be like bidding blind. Without this knowledge of market value, you
                        could easily bid too much, or fail to make a competitive offer at all on an
                        excellent value.
                        </section>
                        <section><h3>2. Buying the Wrong Home</h3></section>
                        <section>What are you looking for in a home? A simple enough question, but the answer
                        can be quite complex. More often than not, buyers have been swept up in the emotion and
                        excitement of the buying process only to find themselves the owner of a home
                        that is either too big or too small. Maybe they're stuck with a longer than
                        desired commute to work, or a dozen more fix-ups than they really want to deal
                        with now that the excitement has died down. Take the time upfront to clearly
                        define your wants and needs. Put it in writing and then use it as a yard stick
                        with which to measure every home you look at. 
                        </section>
                        <section><h3>3. Unclear Title</h3></section>
                        <section>Make sure very early on in the negotiation that you will own your new home
                        free and clear by having a title search completed. The last thing you want to
                        discover when you're in the back stretch of a transaction is that there are
                        encumbrances on the property such as tax liens, undisclosed owners, easements,
                        leases or the like. 
                        </section>
                        <section><h3>4. Inaccurate Survey</h3></section>
                        <section>As part of your offer&nbsp;to purchase, make sure you request an updated property
                        survey which clearly marks your boundaries. If the survey is not current, you
                        may find that there are structural changes that are not shown (e.g. additions to
                        the house, a new swimming pool, a neighbor's new fence which is extending a
                        boundary line, etc.). Be very clear on these issues.
                        </section>
                        <section><h3>5. Undisclosed Fix-ups</h3></section>
                        <section>Don't expect every seller to own up to every physical detail that will need
                        to be attended to. Both you and the seller&nbsp;are out to maximize your investment.
                        Ensure that you conduct a thorough inspection of the home early in the process.
                        Consider hiring an independent inspector to objectively view the home inside
                        and out, and make the final contract contingent upon this inspector's report.
                        This inspector should be able to give you a report of any item that needs to be
                        fixed with associated, approximate cost. 
                        </section>
                        <section><h3>6. Not Getting Mortgage Pre-approval</h3></section>
                        <section>Pre-approval is fast, easy and free. When you have a pre-approved mortgage,
                        you can shop for your home with a greater sense of freedom and security, knowing
                        that the money will be there when you find the home of your dreams. 
                        </section>
                        <section><h3>7. Contract&nbsp;Misses</h3></section>
                        <section>If a seller&nbsp;fails to comply to the letter of the contract&nbsp;by neglecting to
                        attend to some repair issues, or changing the spirit of the agreement in some
                        way, this could delay the final closing and settlement. Agree ahead of time on a
                        dollar amount for an escrow fund to cover items that the seller&nbsp;fails to follow
                        through on. Prepare a list of agreed issues, walk through them, and check them
                        off one by one. 
                        </section>
                        <section><h3>8. Hidden Costs</h3></section>
                        <section>Make sure you identify and uncover all costs - large and small - far enough
                        ahead of time. When a transaction closes, you will sometimes find fees for this
                        or that sneaking through after the “sub”-total&nbsp; fees such as loan
                        disbursement charges, underwriting fees etc. Understand these in advance by
                        having your lender project total charges for you in writing. 
                        </section>
                        <section><h3>9. Rushing the Closing</h3></section>
                        <section>Take your time during this critical part of the process, and insist on seeing
                        all paperwork the day before you sign. Make sure this documentation perfectly
                        reflects your understanding of the transaction, and that nothing has been added
                        or subtracted. Is the interest rate right? Is everything covered? If you rush
                        this process on the day of closing, you may run into a last minute snag that you
                        can't fix without compromising the terms of the deal, the financing, or even the sale itself.
