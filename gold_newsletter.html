      Strikes</font></h2>
      <div align="left">
      <p><font class="txtArial13">Fires . . . hurricanes. . . floods . . . 
      earthquakes . . . tornadoes.... Natural or other disasters can strike 
      suddenly, at any time, and anywhere. Your first priority, of course, would 
      be to protect your family and your property.&nbsp; But it's also important 
      to protect against the financial consequences of a disaster.&nbsp; A 
      disaster can damage or destroy your property, force you to temporarily 
      live somewhere else, cut the flow of wages and other income, or ruin 
      valuable financial records.</font></p>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">Listed here are some simple, common sense 
      steps you can take now.&nbsp; Before you take any actions, however, you 
      should be sure you have involved your family or friends whenever possible 
      in decision making and planning.&nbsp; You also may want the assistance of 
      an advisor, such as a Certified Financial Planner, insurance agent, or 
      similar financial professional.</font></p>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">The important thing is to begin planning now, 
      before the unexpected becomes a harsh reality.</font></p>
      <h5 class="h5s15" align="left">Protect your property</h5>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">One of the first things to do is find out what 
      disasters could strike where you live----fire, flood, earthquake, 
      hurricane, or tornado, for example.&nbsp; The following steps can help you 
      avoid or reduce substantially the potential physical destruction to your 
      property if you were to be hit with a disaster.&nbsp; These steps can 
      reduce your insurance costs, too.&nbsp; For example, you could:</font></p>
      <ul align="left">
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Install smoke detectors to warn of an 
        apartment or home fire.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Elevate utilities to upper floor or attic.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Clear surrounding bush to protect your home 
        against wildfires.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Anchor your house to the foundation, and 
        anchor the roof to the main frame.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Secure objects that could fall and cause 
        damage in an earthquake, such as a bookcase or hot water heater.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Install hurricane shutters on windows, and 
        prepare plywood covers for glass doors.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Cover windows, turn off utilities, or move 
        possessions to a safer location if you have adequate warning of 
        something like a hurricane or flood.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">If your home is in a high risk flood area, 
        on a fault line, or threatened by coastal erosion, consider relocating.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Have your house inspected by a building 
        inspector or architect to find out what structural improvements could 
        prevent or reduce major damage from disasters.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">If you haven't yet bought a house, you 
        might take construction type into account. Frame houses tend to 
        withstand some disasters, while brick homes hold up better in others.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">If you're not sure where to start, you could 
      contact your local fire department.&nbsp; Fire departments will often make 
      house calls to evaluate your property and make suggestions on how to 
      improve safety.&nbsp; In earthquake-prone areas, the local utility can be 
      called upon to come to your location and show you how and where to shut 
      off gas lines or how to elevate utilities to get them above a possible 
      flood.</font></p>
      <h5 class="h5s15" align="left">Conduct a household inventory</h5>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">Inventory your household possessions by making 
      a list of everything you own. If disaster strikes, this list could:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Help you prove the value of what you owned 
        if those possessions are damaged or destroyed.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Make it more likely you'll receive a fast, 
        fair payment from your insurance company for your losses.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Provide documentation for tax deductions 
        you claim for your losses.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">To conduct a thorough home inventory:</font>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Record the location of the originals of all 
        important financial and family documents, such as birth and marriage 
        certificates, wills, deeds, tax returns, insurance policies, and stock 
        and bond certificates.&nbsp; Keep the originals in a safe place and 
        store copies elsewhere.&nbsp; You'll need accessible records for tax and 
        insurance purposes.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Make a visual or written record of your 
        possessions.&nbsp; If you don't own a camera or videotaping equipment 
        (and can't borrow or rent it), buy an inventory booklet and fill it out, 
        or make a simple list on notebook paper.&nbsp; Ask your insurance agent 
        if he or she can provide one.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Go from room to room.&nbsp; Describe each 
        item, when you bought it, and how much it cost.&nbsp; If you're 
        photographing or videotaping, have someone open closet doors and hold up 
        items.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Record model and serial numbers.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Include less expensive items, such as bath 
        towels and clothes.&nbsp; Their costs add up if you have to replace 
        them.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Be sure you include items in your attic, 
        basement, and garage.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Note the quality of building materials, 
        particularly for such furnishings as oak doors or expensive plumbing 
        fixtures.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Photograph the exterior of your home.&nbsp; 
        Include the landscaping---that big tree in the front yard may not be 
        insurable, but it does increase the value of your property for tax 
        purposes.&nbsp; Make special note of any improvements, such as a patio, 
        fencing, or outbuildings.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Photograph cars, boats, and recreational 
        vehicles.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Make copies of receipts and cancelled 
        checks for more valuable items.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Get professional appraisals of jewelry, 
        collectibles, artwork, or other items that are difficult to value.&nbsp; 
        Update the appraisals every two to three years.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Update your inventory list annually.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">Sound like too much work? Computer software 
      programs designed for such purposes can make the task much easier.&nbsp; 
      These programs are readily available in local computer stores.</font></p>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">Most important, once you have completed your 
      inventory, leave a copy with relatives or friends, or in a safe deposit 
      box.&nbsp; Don't leave your only copy at home, where it might be 
      destroyed.</font></p>
      <h5 class="h5s15" align="left">Buy insurance</h5>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">Even with adequate time to prepare for a 
      disaster, you still may suffer significant, unavoidable damage to your 
      property. That's when insurance for renters or homeowners can be a big 
      help.&nbsp; Yet, many people affected by recent disasters have been 
      underinsured-or worse-not insured at all.&nbsp; Homeowners insurance 
      doesn't cover floods and some other major disasters.&nbsp; Make sure you 
      buy the insurance you need to protect against the perils you face.</font></p>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">If you own a home:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Buy, at a minimum, full replacement or 
        replacement cost coverage.&nbsp; This means the structure can be 
        replaced up to the limits specified in the policy.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Investigate buying a guaranteed replacement 
        cost policy.&nbsp; When and where available, these policies can pay to 
        rebuild your house, including improvements, at today's prices, 
        regardless of the limits of the policy.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Have your home periodically reappraised to 
        be sure the policy reflects the real replacement cost.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Update the policy to include any home 
        improvements, such as basement refinishing.&nbsp; Annual automatic 
        increases may not be enough to cover these.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Buy a policy that covers the replacement 
        cost of your possessions.&nbsp; Standard coverage only pays for the 
        actual cash value (replacement cost discounted for age or use).</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Be very clear about what the policy will 
        and will not cover, and how the deductibles work (the part you pay 
        before the policy pays).</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Check government operated insurance pools 
        if you find it difficult to obtain private coverage because of a recent 
        disaster.&nbsp; Premiums often run higher than market rates, but this is 
        better than no coverage.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Use your home inventory list to check that 
        your policy's coverage matches the value of your possessions.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">If you rent: </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">If you are renting, consider locating 
        outside a high risk flood area or away from a fault line.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Buy renter's insurance, which pays for 
        damaged, destroyed, or stolen personal property.&nbsp; Your landlord's 
        insurance won't cover damage to or loss of your possessions.&nbsp; Also, 
        consider special coverage like flood insurance for your belongings.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Be clear about what a policy will cover.&nbsp; 
        Some policies cover more than others.&nbsp; For example, will the policy 
        pay for living expenses if you have to live somewhere else temporarily, 
        or for damage from sewer backup?</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Comparison shop for the best coverage at 
        the best price.&nbsp; Other than government flood insurance, policies 
        vary from company to company.&nbsp; Policies in most areas are very 
        affordable.&nbsp; Start with the company that insures your car.&nbsp; 
        Discounts are often available if you carry more than one policy with a 
        company.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">If you are moving:</font> </p>
      <ul>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Select a home in an area not on a fault 
        line, in a flood area, or at risk from coastal erosion.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="h5s15" align="left">Consider special coverage</h5>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">Insurance for renters and homeowners won't 
      cover certain types of losses.&nbsp; Ask your insurance agent or financial 
      planner about special or additional coverage for the following:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Floods- Homeowner policies don't cover 
        damage from flooding.&nbsp; Call your current insurance company or agent 
        first about getting coverage.</font> </li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Earthquakes- Premiums typically are high, 
        and deductibles may range from 5% to 20% of the policy's coverage.&nbsp; 
        Still, such coverage may be better than no coverage. (Earthquake 
        coverage for the contents of a home usually is separate.)</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Home offices- Some policies automatically 
        extend coverage to computer equipment and a few other items of business 
        property. Talk to your agent to determine what items would or would not 
        be covered.&nbsp; If necessary, you could buy additional business 
        coverage at a modest cost.&nbsp; Or it may be better to buy a separate 
        small business policy, which would also provide more coverage. </font>
        </li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Building codes- Ask your agent about 
        additional insurance to cover the costs of meeting new, stricter 
        building codes.&nbsp; Frequently, after a disaster people get shocked 
        with rebuilding costs that are much higher because building codes have 
        changed.&nbsp; All current codes must be met when rebuilding.&nbsp; 
        Consider additional structural improvements that provide more 
        protection.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Other potential problems- This would 
        include problems such as underground mines (located beneath your 
        property) sewer backup, or mudslides.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Big-ticket items- Purchase additional 
        coverage for specific jewelry, collectibles, artwork, furs, or other 
        big-ticket items.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="h5s15" align="left">Where to keep cash</h5>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">After a disaster, you may need cash for the 
      first few days, or even several weeks.&nbsp; Income may stop if you can't 
      work.&nbsp; To help stay solvent, consider the following:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Keep a small amount of cash or traveler's 
        checks at home in a place where you can get at it quickly in case of a 
        sudden evacuation.&nbsp; A disaster can shut down local ATMs and banks.&nbsp; 
        The money should be in small denominations for easier use.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Set aside money in an emergency fund.&nbsp; 
        That can be tough to do on a tight budget, but it can be well worth the 
        effort.&nbsp; The fund can be very helpful, not only in a disaster, but 
        in other financial crises, such as during unemployment or when 
        unexpected expenses like legal fees arise.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Keep your emergency funds in a safe, easily 
        accessible account, such as a passbook savings account or a money market 
        account.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Keep some funds outside the local area, 
        since the disaster that affects you could also affect your local 
        financial institutions.&nbsp; A mutual fund money market account in 
        another city is one option to consider.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Keep your credit cards paid off. You may 
        have to draw on them to tide you over.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="h5s15" align="left">Use an evacuation box</h5>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">Buy a lockable, durable &quot;evacuation box&quot; to 
      grab in the event of an emergency.&nbsp; Even a cardboard box would do.&nbsp; 
      Put important papers into the box in sealed, waterproof plastic bags.&nbsp; 
      Store the box in your home where you can get to it easily.&nbsp; Keep this 
      box with you at all times, don't leave it in your unattended car.</font></p>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">The box should be large enough to carry:</font>

        insurance company telephone numbers.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Copies of other important financial and 
        family records (or at least a list of their locations).&nbsp; These 
        would include deeds, titles, wills, a letter of instructions, birth and 
        marriage certificates, passports, relevant employee benefits documents, 
        the first two pages of the previous year's income tax returns, etc.&nbsp; 
        Originals, other than wills, should be kept in a safe deposit box or at 
        another location.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Backups of computerized financial records.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">A list of bank account, loan, credit card,

      </ul>
      <h5 class="h5s15" align="left">Rent a safe deposit box</h5>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">Safe deposit boxes are invaluable for 
      protecting originals of important papers. If you don't have a safe deposit 
      box, keep copies in your evacuation box or with family or friends.&nbsp; 
      Original documents to store in a safe deposit box include:</font> </p>
      <ul>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Deeds, titles, and other ownership records 
        for your home, autos, RVs, boats, etc.</font></li>

        papers.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Marriage license/divorce papers and child 
        custody papers.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Passports and military/veteran papers.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Appraisals of expensive jewelry and 
        heirlooms.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Certificates for stocks, bonds, and other 
        investments.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Trust agreements.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Living wills, powers of attorney, and 
        health care powers of attorney.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Insurance policies (copies are sufficient).</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Home improvement records.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Household inventory documentation.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">Generally, originals of wills should not be 
      kept in a safe deposit box since the box may be sealed temporarily after 
      death.&nbsp; Keep originals of wills with your local registrar of wills or 
      your attorney.</font></p>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">Deciding on a safe and convenient location is 
      an issue.&nbsp; You may want to consider renting a safe deposit box in a 
      bank far enough away from your home so it is not likely to be affected by 
      the same disaster that strikes your home (for instance, bank vaults have 
      been flooded). Keep the key to the safe deposit box in your evacuation 
      box.</font></p>
      <h5 class="h5s15" align="left">Home safes and fire boxes</h5>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">Safes and fire boxes can be convenient places 
      to store important papers.&nbsp; However, some disasters, such as 
      hurricanes, floods, or tornadoes, could destroy your home.&nbsp; Usually, 
      it's better to store original papers in a safe deposit box or at another 
      location well away from your home.</font></p>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">If you have time...</font></p>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">Some disasters, such as tornadoes or 
      earthquakes, strike with little or no warning.&nbsp; Others, such as 
      floods or hurricanes, may allow some time to prepare.&nbsp; If there is 
      enough time, you could take the following actions:</font> </p>
      <ul>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Decide what household items you would put 
        on a very short priority list.&nbsp; For example, imagine you could take 
        only one suitcase or pack a single carload.&nbsp; What would you take?&nbsp; 
        Involve the whole family in this discussion.&nbsp; Take jewelry and 
        other small valuables.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Take irreplaceable heirlooms, mementos, and 
        photos.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Don't bother with replaceable items such as 
        televisions, furniture, computers, and clothing (except what you need to 
        wear for a few days).</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Be sure, however, to take a battery-powered 
        radio and spare batteries so you can stay informed.</font></li>
        <li><font class="txtArial13">Take important papers and computer disks if 
        you have a home business.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font class="txtArial13">Whew! These are a lot of ideas.&nbsp; You may 
      not be able to do everything that is suggested---that's OK.&nbsp; Do what 
      you can.&nbsp; Taking even limited action now will go a long way toward 
      preparing you financially before a disaster strikes.</font></p>  <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p align="left"><FONT class="txtArial13"> <b>If youre like most homebuyers, you have two primary 
    considerations in mind when you start looking for a home. First, you want to 
    find a home that perfectly meets your needs and desires, and secondly, you 
    want to purchase this home for the lowest possible price. </b></font></p>
    <p align="left"><FONT class="txtArial13">When you analyze those successful homebuyers who have been 
    able to purchase the home they want for thousands of dollars below a 
    sellers asking price, some common denominators emerge. Although your agents 
    negotiating skills are important, there are three additional key factors 
    that must come into play long before you ever submit an offer. </font></p>

<h4 class="h4s16" align=left>These Steps Will Help You Save Thousands When You Buy a 
    Home </h4>
    <p align="left"><FONT class="txtArial13"><b>Make sure you know what you want . . . </b>As simple as 
    this sounds, many home buyers don't have a firm idea in their heads before 
    they go out searching for a home. In fact, when you go shopping for a place 
    to live, there are actually <u><i>two</i></u> homes competing for your 
    attention: <b>the one that meets your needs, and the one that fulfills your 
    desires. </b>Obviously, your goal is to find <i><u>one</u></i> home that 
    does <i><u>both</u></i>. But in the real world, this situation doesn't 
    always occur. </font></p>

    <p align="left"><FONT class="txtArial13">When you're looking at homes, you'll find that you fall in 
    love with one or another home for entirely different reasons. Is it better 
    to buy the 4 bedroom home with room for your family to grow, or the one 
    with the big eat in kitchen that romances you with thoughts of big weekend 
    family brunches? What's more important: a big backyard, or proximity to your 
    child's school? <b>Far too often people buy a home for the wrong reasons, 
    and then regret their decision when the home doesn't meet their needs.</b>
    </p></font>
    <p align="left"><FONT class="txtArial13"><b>Don't shop with stars in your eyes: </b><i>satisfy your 
    needs first</i>. If you're lucky, you'll find a home that does this and also 
    fulfills your desires. The important thing is to understand the difference 
    before you get caught up in the excitement of looking. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><FONT class="txtArial13"><b>Find out if your agent offers a Buyer Profile System or 
    &quot;Househunting Service&quot;, </b>which takes the guesswork out of finding just 
    the right home that matches your needs. This type of program will 
    cross-match your criteria with ALL available homes on the market and supply 
    you with printed information on an ongoing basis. A program like this helps 
    homeowners take off their rose colored glasses and, affordably, move into 
    the home of their dreams. </font></p>

<h4 class="h4s16" align=left>How Sellers Set Their Asking Price </h4>
    <p align="left"><FONT class="txtArial13">For you to understand how much to offer for a home youre 
    interested in, its important for you to know how sellers price their homes. 
    Here are 4 common strategies youll start to recognize when you begin to 
    view homes: </font></p>
 <h5 class="h5s15" align=left>
 1. Clearly Overpriced: </h5>
    <p align="left"><FONT class="txtArial13">Every seller wants to realize the most amount of money they 
    can for their home, and real estate agents know this. If more than one agent 
    is competing for your listing, an easy way to win the battle is to 
    over inflate the value of your home. This is done far too often, with many 
    homes that are priced 10- 20% over their true market value. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><FONT class="txtArial13">This is not in your best interest, because in most cases the 
    market won't be fooled. As a result, your home could languish on the market 
    for months, leaving you with a couple of important drawbacks: </font></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      <p align="left"><FONT class="txtArial13">your home is likely to be labelled as a &quot;troubled&quot; house by 
      other agents, leading to a lower than fair market price when an offer is 
      finally made </font></li>

      <li>
      <p align="left"><FONT class="txtArial13">you have been greatly inconvenienced with having to 
      constantly have your home in &quot;showing&quot; condition . . . for nothing. These 
      homes often expire off the market, forcing you to go through the listing 
      process all over again.</font> </li>
    </ul>
   <h5 class="h5s15" align=left>2. Somewhat Overpriced: </h5>
    <p align="left"><FONT class="txtArial13">About 3/4 of the homes on the market are 5-10% overpriced. 
    These homes will also sit on the market longer than they should. There is 
    usually one of two factors at play here: either you believe in your heart 
    that your home is really worth this much despite what the market has 
    indicated (after all, there's a lot of emotion caught up in this issue), OR 
    you've left some room for negotiating. Either way, this strategy will cost 
    you both in terms of time on the market and ultimate price received </font></p>
 <h5 class="h5s15" align=left>3. Priced Correctly at Market Value </h5>

    <p align="left"><FONT class="txtArial13">Some sellers understand that real estate is part of the 
    capitalistic system of supply and demand and will carefully and 
    realistically price their homes based on a thorough analysis of other homes 
    on the market. These competitively priced homes usually sell within a 
    reasonable time frame and very close to the asking price. </font></p>
     <h5 class="h5s15" align=left>4. Priced Below the Fair Market Value </h5>
    <p align="left"><FONT class="txtArial13">Some sellers are motivated by a quick sale. These homes 
    attract multiple offers and sell fast - usually in a few days - at, or 
    above, the asking price. Be cautious that the agent suggesting this method 
    is doing so with your best interest in mind.

                <td>        <h2 class="h2s20" align="center">Surges Happen! How To Protect the Appliances In Your Home</font></h2>
<div align="left">


 <p><FONT class="txtArial13">The power you get from the wall outlet is known as &quot;120 volts AC power.&quot; 
    The power companies try to keep that voltage uniform. Lightning, 
    short-circuits, poles knocked down by cars, or some other accident can make 
    the voltage jump to hundreds, even thousands of volts. This is what 
    engineers call a &quot;surge.&quot; A surge will last only a few millionths of one 
    second (the &quot;blink of an eye&quot; is thousands of times longer than the typical 
    surge). It is enough to destroy or to upset your appliances.  </font></p>

   <H4 class="h4s16">What can a surge do to your appliances? </h4>
  <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Your appliances are designed to run on the normal 120 volts AC supply, 
    with some tolerance for more or less, but they can be damaged, or their 
    controls can be upset by surges. The result is then frustration and repair 
    bills, and even a fire in rare cases.  </font></p>

 <H4 class="h4s16">Disturbances</h4>



  <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Normal - This is the voltage that we all take for granted, every second 
    of the minute, every minute of the hour, every hour of the day, every day of 
    the year. But occasionally, for a short time...  </font></p>

    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">The voltage falls below normal: a sag. Sags are unlikely to damage most 
    appliances, but they can make a computer crash, confuse some digital clocks 
    and cause VCRs to forget their settings.   </font></p>
    

  <p><FONT class="txtArial13">The reverse of a sag is called a swell: a short duration increase in the 
    line voltage. This disturbance might upset sensitive appliances, and damage 
    them if it is a very large or very long swell.  </font></p>

   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Noise is a catch word sometimes used to describe very small and 
    persistent disturbances. These do not have damaging effects but can be a 
    nuisance.   </font></p>

    
    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">There is, of course, the ultimate disturbance: an outage -no voltage at 
    all!   </font></p>

   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">These disturbances are different from surges, but they should be 
    mentioned because the remedies are generally different. As we will see 
    later, some available devices can help overcome both sensitive appliances in 
    your home.   </font></p>

    
   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Your home contains all sorts, types or kinds of appliances. These not 
    only include the traditional household helpers, but also the entertainment 
    electronics, the family's computer(s), smart telephones, control systems 
    (thermostats, garage door, etc.), and all the new things to come.  </font></p>



<p><FONT class="txtArial13">More and more, traditional large appliances in your home depend on very 
    sophisticated electronics for their control. This can often make them 
    sensitive to surges (as well as power interruptions).  </font></p>
  <p><FONT class="txtArial13">To help sort out which types of your appliances might be damaged or 
    upset, you can describe them in general terms depending on their 
    connections: power, telephone, cable, or antennas. Each of these connections 
    offers a path for a surge to come in, something that might be overlooked 
    when the cause of damage is explained as a &quot;power surge.&quot;   </font></p>

   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">The first type includes electronics that are connected only to the power, 
    such as a computer with no modem, a TV set with rabbit ears, a VCR not 
    connected to cable TV, a table-top radio, a microwave oven, etc. Surge 
    protection of these is not particularly difficult, and quite often it is 
    already built-in by the manufacturer.   </font></p>

    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">The second type, for which more protection might be needed, includes 
    electronics that are powered, of course, from your power receptacles but 
    also connected to an external communications system: telephone, cable TV, 
    satellite receiver. A slightly different but similar situation, which also 
    needs attention, is that of appliances connected to a household control 
    system such as garage door opener, intrusion or fire alarm, automatic 
    sprinklers, or intercom.   </font></p>
  <p><FONT class="txtArial13">We will see later why the two kinds of appliances face different risks of 
    being damaged and consequently might require different protection methods.  </font>
    </p>
      <H4 class="h4s16">Where do surges come from?</h4>
   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">There are two origins for the surges that occur in your power system: 
    lightning surges and switching surges.  </font></p>
    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Lightning surges, occur when a lightning bolt strikes between a cloud and 
    objects on earth. The effect can be direct --injection of the lightning 
    current into the object, or indirect --inducing a voltage into electrical 
    circuits.   </font></p>

   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">We will look at ways of protecting your appliances against lightning 
    surges that come by way of the wires -power, telephone, cable, etc. 
    Protection of the house against the direct effects of lightning is done by 
    properly grounded lightning rods. Note also that lightning rods are intended 
    to protect the structure of the house and avoid fires. They do not prevent 
    surges from happening in the wiring.   </font></p>

    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Direct lightning effects are limited to the object being struck and its 
    surroundings, so that the occurrence is considered rare but it is nearly 
    always deadly for persons or for trees. Well-protected electrical systems 
    can survive a direct strike, perhaps with some momentary disturbances from 
    which they recover (blinking lights and computers restarting during a 
    lightning storm). The key word, of course, is &quot;well-protected&quot; and this 
    information will help ensure your home has a well- protected electrical 
    system.   </font></p>
   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Indirect lightning effects are less dramatic than from a direct strike, 
    but they reach further out, either by radiating around the strike, or by 
    propagating along power lines, telephone system and cable TV. From the point 
    of view of the home dweller, unwanted opening of the garage door, or a surge 
    coming from the power company during a lightning storm, would be seen as 
    indirect effects.   </font></p>
    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Switching surges occur when electrical loads are turned on or off within 
    your home, as well as by the normal operations of the power company. An 
    analogy often given is the &quot;water hammer&quot; that can occur in your piping if a 
    faucet is turned off too quickly: the electric current flowing in the wires 
    tries to flow for a short time after the switch has been opened, producing a 
    surge in the wiring, just like the surge of pressure in the piping.  </font></p>

   <H4 class="h4s16">How often, how far, how severe?</h4>

   <h5 class="h5s15">So, surges can and do happen!</h5>
     <p><FONT class="txtArial13">These questions -how often do surges occur, how far do they travel before 
    hitting your appliances, how severe are they - must be answered, as well as 
    possible, so that you can proceed to the next step of taking calculated 
    risks or making a reasonable investment by purchasing some additional 
    protection. There are several ways of getting surge protection, from the 
    simple purchase of a plug-in device from an electronic store, to the 
    installation of protective devices for the whole house, to be done by an 
    electrician or the power company.   </font></p>
    <h5 class="h5s15">How often?</h5>
    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">You are probably best placed to answer that question if you have lived in 
    your neighborhood for several years. Lightning is random but can strike more 
    than one time at the same place. There are now sophisticated means to record 
    the occurrence of individual lightning strikes; electric utilities and 
    businesses seek the data to make decisions on the risks and needs for 
    investing in protection schemes. The reason for mentioning &quot;several years in 
    your neighborhood&quot; is that the frequency of lightning strikes varies over 
    the years and the section of the country where you live.   </font></p>

    <h5 class="h5s15">How far, how severe?</h5>

     <p><FONT class="txtArial13">The answers to these two questions are linked: a nearby lightning strike 
    has more severe consequences than an equal strike occurring farther away. 
    There is also a wide range in the severity of the strike itself, with the 
    very severe or very mild being rare, the majority being in mid-range (a 
    current of about 20,000 amperes for a short time) -but still much shorter 
    than the blink of an eye.  </font> </p>
   <h5 class="h5s15">Calculated risk or insurance?</h5>
   <h5 class="h5s15">The trade off: </h5>
    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">A large stack of dollar bills and some change to replace your unprotected 
    computer, if and when a lightning or some other surge destroyed it ...  </font></p>
    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">... or use a small number of bills to purchase a &quot;surge protector&quot; for 
    peace of mind and effective protection.   </font></p>

  <p><FONT class="txtArial13">If you look at it from that point of view, the choice is probably easy 
    and, most likely, you will be looking for one of those &quot;surge protectors&quot; 
    -or some device with a similar name to do the same job, as explained next.  </font></p>
    <H4 class="h4s16">What's in a name? </h4>
    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">When you walk in the computer store or electronic supply store, you might 
    ask for something to protect your appliances against surges, but what to 
    call it ? The devices that can protect against surges are called 
    &quot;surge-protective devices&quot; by engineers, but that sounds too much like 
    jargon to some people.   </font></p>
    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">One name that seems to stick is &quot;surge suppressor&quot; with a variety of 
    trademark names. The Underwriter's Laboratories chose to call them 
    &quot;Transient Voltage Surge Suppressor&quot; and you might find that name or the 
    TVSS acronym next to the listing on the product. Always make sure that the 
    product has been tested by a product safety testing organization, such as 
    UL, ETL, or CSA, as indicated by their labels.   </font></p>

    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">You cannot really suppress a surge altogether, nor &quot;arrest&quot; it (although 
    your utility uses devices they call &quot;surge arresters&quot; to protect their 
    systems). What these protective devices do is neither suppress nor arrest a 
    surge, but simply divert it to ground, where it can do no harm.   </font></p>
     <H4 class="h4s16">Decisions, decisions </h4>
     <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Surge protectors come in many shapes and forms for many purposes, not 
    just the plug-in kind that you find in the electronic stores. There are 
    several ways to install them on your power supply: plug and play, 
    do-it-yourself, hire a licensed electrician to do it, or even call on your 
    power company to do it. Here is a run down on your options, and who does it:  </font></p>
    <ul class="txtArial13">

      <li><FONT class="txtArial13">Purchase one or more plug-in surge protectors   </font></li>
      <li><FONT class="txtArial13">Install a surge protector at the service entrance panel   </font></li>
      <li><FONT class="txtArial13">Have the power company install a surge protector next to the meter  </font>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5 class="h5s15">Plug-in surge protectors</h5>
   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">This is the easiest solution, and there are a wide variety of brands 
    available in the stores. These come in two forms: a box that plugs directly 
    into a wall receptacle, or a strip with a power cord and multiple outlets. 
    Depending on the appliance, you will look for a simple AC power plug-in, or 
    a more complex combined protector for AC power and telephone or cable. 
    However, before you purchase the right protector for the job, you should 
    think about some details.  </font></p>

  <p><FONT class="txtArial13">There is another decision to make, concerning how a surge protector will 
    power your appliance if the protective element should fail under extreme 
    cases of exposure to a large surge or large swell. Most surge protectors are 
    provided internally with some kind of fuse that will disconnect in case of 
    failure. However, this disconnect can operate in two different ways, 
    depending on the design of the surge protector: some will completely cut off 
    the output power, others will disconnect the failed element but maintain the 
    power output.   </font></p>
    <h5 class="h5s15" align="left">Quit and be protected or continue? </h5>
   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">For you, it is a matter of choice: would you want to maintain the output 
    power to your appliance -but with no more surge protection? Or would you 
    rather maintain protection for sure -by having the circuit of the protector 
    cut off the power supply to your appliance, if the protective function were 
    to fail? To make an intelligent decision, you must know which of the two 
    possibilities are designed into the surge protector that you will be looking 
    for.   </font></p>
     <h5 class="h5s15" align="left">What are the lights telling you? </h5>
   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">To help the consumer know what is going on inside the surge protector, 
    many manufacturers provide some form of indication, generally by one or more 
    pilot lights on the device. Unfortunately, these indications are not 
    standardized, and the meaning might be confusing, between one, two - even 
    three or four lights -where it is not always clear what their color means. 
    Read the instructions!   </font></p>
   <H4 class="h4s16">More decisions ... </h4>

   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">So far, we have looked mostly at the plug-in surge protectors because 
    they are the easiest to install and they do not require the services of an 
    electrician. The two other possible locations for surge protectors are the 
    service panel (breaker panel) and the meter socket.  </font></p>
     <h5 class="h5s15">Service-panel surge protectors </h5>
    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Instead of using several plug in protectors -one for each sensitive 
    appliance is sometimes recommended -you can install a protector at the 
    service panel of the house (also called &quot;service entrance&quot; or &quot;breaker 
    box&quot;). The idea is that with one device, all appliances in the house can be 
    protected, perhaps with a few plug-in protectors next to the most sensitive 
    appliances. There are two types of devices available: incorporated in the 
    panel, or outside the panel.   </font></p>
     <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Some breaker panel manufacturers also offer a snap in surge protector, 
    taking the space of two breakers (assuming that there are blank spaces 
    available on the panel), and easily installed by the home owner or by an 
    electrician. However, there are two limitations or conditions to that 
    approach:   </font></p>

  <p><FONT class="txtArial13">The snap in protectors generally fit only in a breaker panel from the 
    same manufacturer -possibly down to the model or vintage of the panel.  </font> </p>
  <p><FONT class="txtArial13">To install the snap in protector, you must remove the front panel (do 
    turn off the main breaker before you do that). Most cities have codes 
    allowing the home owner to do it, under some conditions. Check with your 
    local authorities to find out if they allow you to do that, or hire a 
    licensed electrician to do the installation for you. There are other surge 
    protectors packaged for wiring into the service panel, either within or next 
    to the panel. That kind of installation is best left to a licensed 
    electrician.  </font></p>
    <h5 class="h5s15">At the meter socket </h5>
  <p><FONT class="txtArial13">There might be a possibility that the power company in your area offers, 
    as an option, to install a surge protector with a special adapter, fitting 
    it between the meter and its socket (the dark band in the bubble of the 
    picture). But that type of device and installation is out of the question as 
    a do-it-yourself project, and will require cooperation from the power 
    company, if they do offer the program.   </font></p>
   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Other types of outdoor surge protectors can be installed near the meter. 
    That kind of installation must be done by a licensed electrician.   </font></p>
     <H3 class="h3s18"><font color="black">Check list </font></h3>

   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Before you decide which way you want to protect your appliances, there 
    are other points to consider.  </font> </p>
      <h5 class="h5s15">Where do you live? </h5>
    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">This is an important question because the type of dwelling has some 
    effect on how severe your surge problem might be. In a somewhat simplified 
    way, consider three categories according to the arrangement of the 
    utilities:   </font></p>
    <ul class="txtArial13">
      <li><FONT class="txtArial13">Detached house with power and telephone and/or cable TV drops at 
      opposite ends of the house -the worst possible arrangement of all. But do 
      not fret, there is a way of compensating, even after the fact, for this 
      unfortunate situation, as we will see.   </font></li>
      <li><FONT class="txtArial13">Detached house with all services (power, cable TV, phone) entering on 
      the same side of the house.   </font></li>

      <li><FONT class="txtArial13">Townhouse or apartment building with services entering the building at 
      one point and fanned out to the different dwellings - about the same as 
      the case of the detached house with all services on the same side.   </font></li>
    </ul>
   <h5 class="h5s15">What appliances are you using?</h5>
    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">From the surge protection point of view, there are four kinds of 
    appliances, with examples listed below by order of increasing sensitivity to 
    surges, either because of their nature or because of their exposure:   </font></p>
   <ul class="txtArial13">
      <li><FONT class="txtArial13">Motor-driven and heating appliances <br>

      Washers (dish and clothes), food processors, power tools, heating and 
      ventilation motors, pumps, etc. <br>

      Water heaters, space heaters, toasters, incandescent light bulbs   </font></li>
      <li><FONT class="txtArial13">Free-standing electronic appliances <br>
      Computers without modem, table radios, TV sets with rabbit ears Compact 
      fluorescent and modern tube type fluorescent lamps   </font></li>
      <li><FONT class="txtArial13">Communications-connected appliances <br>
      Computers with modem, TV with cable or satellite antenna, fax machines, 
      telephone answering/recording machines   </font></li>

      <li><FONT class="txtArial13">Signal systems <br>

      Intruder alarms, garage door openers, sprinklers, intercom   </font></li>
    </ul>
   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Let's then take a quick look at each of these and see which might need 
    some form of surge protection.  </font></p>
   <h5 class="h5s15">Motor-driven appliances and heating appliances </h5>
  <p><FONT class="txtArial13">For each of these two categories, there can be two or more kinds, 
    depending on the type of control used.  </font> </p>

    <ul class="txtArial13">
      <li><FONT class="txtArial13">Mechanical control (ON-OFF switch, rotary control, etc.), no 
      sophisticated key pad or other electronic control   </font></li>

      <li><FONT class="txtArial13">Electronic control (programmable operation, key pad, display, etc.)
        </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Appliances with mechanical controls are generally insensitive to surges 
    and can be expected to withstand the typical surges that occur in a 
    residence. Extreme cases, such as a direct lightning strike to the building, 
    or one to the utility, very close, might cause damage. </p></font>
    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Appliances with electronic controls can be more susceptible to damage 
    than those with mechanical controls. Less traumatic but annoying can be 
    upset memory in programmable appliances, although progress is being made in 
    providing more built in protection. </p></font>

    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Another difference to be noted is that of appliances permanently 
    connected, as opposed to those in intermittent use. The risk of a damaging 
    surge happening at the time of intermittent use is much smaller than that of 
    an appliance which is on all the time. </p></font>
    <h4 class="h4s16">What kind of appliances? </h4>

    <h5 class="h5s15">Electronic appliances </h5>
    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Power companies sometimes include as bill stuffers the suggestion to 
    disconnect your appliances when a severe lightning storm is approaching. But 
    that is no help if you are not in the house at that time. If, on the other 
    hand, you are in the house, pulling out the power cord of an appliance that 
    remains connected to a telephone line or cable TV might not be the best 
    idea: you would lose the grounding of the appliance normally done by the 
    power cord - possibly a safety problem should a surge come upon the 
    telephone or cable TV. </p></font>
  <p><FONT class="txtArial13">This information should help you make the choices that fit your needs for 
    surge protection. To make the right choice, it is useful to note that there 
    are two types of electronic appliances. For each of these types, a different 
    type of surge protector might be needed. These types include: </p></font>
    <ul class="h5s15">

      <li><FONT class="txtArial13">Simple, one link connection to power the system   </font></li>
      <li><FONT class="txtArial13">Dual connection to both power and communications   </font></li>

    </ul>
    <h5 class="h5s15">One-link connections </h5>
     <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Examples of one-link connection of powered electronic appliances include 
    a TV set with &quot;rabbit ears&quot; antenna, a portable radio receiver, a computer 
    with no modem connection or remote printer, a compact fluorescent lamp, etc. 
    In the category of one-link connection we also find an old-fashioned 
    telephone connected only to the telephone system. </p></font>

    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Note that most of these have a two prong plug, which is their sole 
    connection to the power system. For the TV set, a simple&quot; AC plug in surge 
    protector on the power cord would be sufficient. For just the Clamp, the 
    cost of a surge protector &quot; would be greater than the cost of simply 
    replacing the lamp, if damaged by a surge -and therefore not be justified.
    </p></font>

   <h5 class="h5s15">Two-link connections </h5>
    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">This type of appliance is another matter. Typical of these would be a 
    computer with a modem, a video system with cable or satellite link, a phone 
    system directly powered from a receptacle (those with a large adapter plug 
    and a thin cable with jack which goes to the appliance generally have 
    sufficient internal isolation against surges). </p></font>
    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">The surge problem with this type of appliance is that a surge coming in 
    from one of the two systems -power or communications -can damage the 
    appliance, because of a difference in the voltage between the two systems 
    when the surge occurs. This can happen even when there are surge protectors 
    on each of the systems. Fortunately, you can find a special type of surge 
    protector against the problem, as described next. </p></font>

  
  <h5 class="h5s15">Equalizing differences </h5>
 <p><FONT class="txtArial13">A simple solution to the problem of voltage differences for two-link 
    appliances is to install a special surge protector that incorporates, in the 
    same package, a combination of input/output connections for the two systems. 
    Each link, power and communications, is fed through the protector which is 
    then inserted between the wall receptacles and the input of the appliance to 
    be protected. This type of surge protector is readily available in computer 
    and electronics stores, and the electrical section of home building stores.
    </p></font>

   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">In addition to words on the package, it can be recognized by the presence 
    of either a pair of telephone jacks or video coax connectors in addition to 
    the power receptacles. Some models might have all three in the same package. 
    Do note a few words of caution: (1) Read carefully the instructions or 
    markings to find which is &quot;in&quot; and which is &quot;out&quot; for the telephone wires. 
    It is important to note, before you buy the product, whether your wall 
    receptacles are wired for three-prong power cords. Some of these combined 
    protectors might not work very well if plugged into a 2-blade receptacle, 
    using a &quot;cheater&quot; plug. (On some, an indicating light will signal that.) </p></font>

    <H4 class="h4s16">Not just power-line surges</h4>
   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Among other disturbances on the power lines, there was a brief mention of 
    sags and outages. You are certainly and unhappily well- acquainted with 
    outages that can occur for any number of reasons beyond the control of your 
    utility. Sags -a brief decrease of the line voltage -can be more subtle and 
    do occur more often than the complete outage. You will notice these when the 
    lights dim momentarily, digital clocks or VCR controls blink, or your 
    computer shuts down then reboots -possibly losing some data. </p></font>

   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Industrial and commercial users, health-care facilities and other 
    critical systems have for many years used a device called &quot;uninterruptible 
    power supply&quot; (UPS) that provides continuous power across a sag, or for the 
    first portion of an extended outage (an independent local power generator 
    set can then kick in). </p></font>
   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">The aggravation of consumers caused by sags and outages has created a 
    mass market for consumer applications, making them affordable when looked at 
    as protection against these annoying (but not damaging) disturbances -and 
    with built in surge protection as a bonus in many cases. These consumer type UPSs have a small battery which is sufficient to ride through any sag and 
    short outages. Some models even include the software to make a computer shut 
    down in an orderly sequence in case of a long outage. </p></font>

   <H4 class="h4s16">Surges in other systems </h4>
     <p><FONT class="txtArial13">So far, we have looked at surges on the power line alone, or on a 
    combination of power and communications lines. Surges of a slightly 
    different kind can also happen in parts of other electrical systems that do 
    not directly involve a power line. Examples of these are: the antenna for a 
    remote garage door opener, the sensor wiring for an intrusion alarm system, 
    the video signal part of a satellite dish receiver. Surges in these systems 
    are caused by nearby lightning strikes.</p></font>
     <p><FONT class="txtArial13">These other systems just mentioned have not been the subject of standards 
    on surge protection as much as power and telephone systems. Furthermore, 
    protective devices for these other systems are not as readily available to 
    consumers. It is more difficult to offer well-defined guidance on surge 
    protection for these systems. Applying preventive surge protection schemes 
    to an existing system might be difficult when the sensitivity of such a 
    system to surges is not known. When considering installation of a new 
    system, it would be a good idea to ask specific questions on that subject 
    before signing the contract. </p></font>

     <h5 class="h5s15">Protection for other systems </h5>
   <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Some codes or practices aimed at providing safety for persons, when they 
    are correctly applied, can also provide some equipment protection. </p></font>
     <p><FONT class="txtArial13">For instance, the general practice of telephone companies is to provide a 
    surge protector as part of their services at the point where the telephone 
    line enters the house (in dense urban environments, the National Electrical 
    Code allows an exception). This protector is known as the &quot;Network Interface 
    Device&quot; (NID) and you will find it on the outside of your house. </p></font>

    <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Another example of code requirement is that of cable TV systems for which 
    the National Electrical Code requires proper safety-oriented grounding 
    practices. The problem, however, is that in some cases, the video equipment 
    can still be damaged by voltage differences. </p></font>
     <p><FONT class="txtArial13">With the increasing popularity of small-dish satellite receivers, 
    installation by the user as do-it-yourself has also increased. Typical 
    instructions for installation show how to make the connections, for instance 
    in the figure at right. What the figure does not show is the need to provide 
    a combined protector for power, telephone, and cable. </p></font>

  <p><FONT class="txtArial13">A well pump installed outside the house presents a double challenge: 
    protection the pump motor itself against surges, and protection the house 
    wiring against surges that might enter the house by the line that powers the 
    pump. The first protection is generally built-in for modern submersible 
    pumps. The second protection should be provided by surge protector installed 
    at the point where the power line to the pump leaves the house, using 
    protectors similar to those applied at the power line service entrance.</p></font>
     <p><FONT class="txtArial13">Intruder alarm systems using wires between sensors and their central 
    control unit can be disturbed -and damaged in severe cases -by lightning 
    striking close to the house. The wires necessary for this type of 
    installation extend to all points of the house and act as an antenna system 
    that collects energy from the field generated by the lightning strike, and 
    protection should be included in the design of the system, rather than added 
    later by the owner. Wireless systems are less sensitive than wired systems.
