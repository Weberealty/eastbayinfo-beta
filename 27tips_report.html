                        <section>Your motivation to sell is the determining factor as to how you will approach
                        the process. It affects everything from what you set your asking price at to how
                        much time, money and effort you're willing to invest in order to prepare your
                        home for sale. For example, if your goal is for a quick sale, this would
                        determine one approach. If you want to maximize your profit, the sales process
                        might take longer thus determining a different approach.

                        <section><h3>2. Keep the Reason(s) You are Selling to Yourself </h3></section>
                        <section>The reason(s) you are selling your home will affect the way you negotiate its
                        sale. By keeping this to yourself you don't provide ammunition to your
                        prospective buyers. For example, should they learn that you must move quickly,
                        you could be placed at a disadvantage in the negotiation process. When asked,
                        simply say that your housing needs have changed. Remember, the reason( s) you
                        are selling is only for you to know .

                        <section><h3>3. Before Setting a Price&nbsp;- Do Your Homework</h3></section>
                        <section>When you set your price, you make buyers aware of the absolute maximum they
                        have to pay for your home. As a seller, you will want to get a selling price as
                        close to the list price&nbsp;as possible. If you start out by pricing too high you
                        run the risk of not being taken seriously by buyers and their agents.  If you are pricing
                        too low it can result in selling for much less than you were hoping for.

                        identical floor plans, built in the same period, simply look at recent sales in
                        your neighborhood subdivision to give you a good idea of what your home is
                        worth.

                        In this case you may want to consider seeking a Realtor &reg; to help you with

                        to look at homes that have sold in your neighborhood&nbsp;within the past 6 months,
                        including those now on the market. This is how prospective buyers will assess
                        the worth of your home. Also a trip to City Hall can provide you with home sale
                        information in its public records, for most communities.

                        off is to check out other open houses. Note floor plans, condition, appearance,
                        size of lot, location and other features. Particularly note, not only the asking
                        prices but what they are actually selling for. Remember, if you're serious about
                        getting your home sold fast, don't price&nbsp;it higher than your neighbor's.

                        <section>Sometimes a good appraisal can be a benefit in marketing your home. Getting
                        an appraisal&nbsp;is a good way to let prospective buyers know that your home can be
                        financed. However, an appraisal&nbsp;does cost money, has a limited life, and there's
                        no guarantee&nbsp;you'll like the figure you hear.

                        <section>Some people think that tax assessments are a way of evaluating a home. The
                        difficulty here is that assessments are based on a number of criteria that may
                        not be related to property values, so they may not necessarily reflect your
                        home's true value.

                        <section><h3>7. Deciding Upon a Realtor&reg;</h3></section>
                        <section>According to the National Association of Realtors, nearly two-thirds of the
                        people surveyed who sell their own homes say they wouldn't do it again
                        themselves. Primary reasons included setting a price, marketing handicaps,
                        liability concerns, and time constraints. When deciding upon a Realtor&reg; ,
                        consider two or three. Be as wary of quotes that are too low as those that are
                        too high. 
                        </section>
                        <section>All Realtors&reg; are not the same! A professional Realtor&reg; knows the market
                        and has information on past sales, current listings, a marketing plan, and will
                        provide their background and references. Evaluate each candidate carefully on
                        the basis of their experience, qualifications, enthusiasm and personality. Be
                        sure you choose someone that you trust and feel confident that they will do a
                        good job on your behalf. 
                        </section>
                        <section>If you choose to sell on your own, you can still talk to a Realtor&reg;. Many
                        are more than willing to help do-it-your-selfers with paperwork, contracts, etc.
                        and should problems arise, you now have someone you can readily call upon.

                        <section>Before settling on your asking price&nbsp;make sure you leave yourself enough room
                        in which to bargain. For example, set your lowest and highest selling price.
                        Then check your priorities to know if you'll price&nbsp;high to maximize your profit
                        or price&nbsp;closer to market value if you want sell quickly.

                        <section>Appearance is so critical that it would be unwise to ignore this when selling
                        your home. The look and &quot;feel&quot; of your home will generate a greater
                        emotional response than any other factor. Prospective buyers react to what they
                        see, hear, feel, and smell even though you may have priced your home to sell.

                        <section><h3>10. Invite the Honest Opinions of Others</h3></section>
                        <section>The biggest mistake you can make at this point is to rely solely on your own
                        judgment. Don't be shy about seeking the honest opinions of others. You need to
                        be objective about your home's good points as well as bad. Fortunately, your
                        Realtor&reg; will be unabashed about discussing what should be done to make your
                        home more marketable.

                        Insignificant</h3>
                        </section>
                        <section>Scrub, scour, tidy up, straighten, get rid of the clutter, declare war on
                        dust, repair squeaks, the light switch that doesn't work, and the tiny crack in
                        the bathroom mirror because these can be deal-killers and you'll never know what
                        turns buyers off. Remember, you're not just competing with other resale homes,
                        but brand-new ones as well.

                        <section>The last thing you want prospective buyers to feel when viewing your home is
                        that they may be intruding into someone's life. Avoid clutter such as too many
                        knick-knacks, etc. Decorate in neutral colors, like white or beige and place a
                        few carefully chosen items to add warmth and character. You can enhance the
                        attractiveness of your home with a well-placed vase of flowers or potpourri in
                        the bathroom. Home-decor magazines are great for tips.

                        <section>You may not realize but odd smells like traces of food, pets and smoking
                        odors can kill deals quickly. If prospective buyers know you have a dog, or that
                        you smoke, they'll start being aware of odors and seeing stains that may not
                        even exist. Don't leave any clues.

                        <section>Smart sellers are proactive in disclosing all known defects to their buyers
                        in writing. This can reduce liability and prevent lawsuits later on.
                        </section>

                        <section>When you maximize your home's marketability, you will most likely attract
                        more than one prospective buyer. It is much better to have several buyers
                        because they will compete with each other; a single buyer will end up competing
                        with you.

                        <section>Let go of the emotion you've invested in your home. Be detached, using a
                        business-like manner in your negotiations. You'll definitely have an advantage
                        over those who get caught up emotionally in the situation.

                        <section>The better you know your buyers the better you can use the negotiation
                        process to your advantage. This allows you to control the pace and duration of
                        the process. 
                        </section>
                        <section>As a rule, buyers are looking to purchase the best affordable property for
                        the least amount of money. Knowing what motivates them enables you to negotiate
                        more effectively. For example, does your buyer&nbsp;need to move quickly. Armed with
                        this information you are in a better position to bargain. 
                        </section>

                        <section>As soon as possible, try to learn the amount of mortgage the buyer&nbsp;is
                        qualified to carry and how much his/her down payment is. If their offer is low,
                        ask their Realtor&reg; about the buyer's ability to pay what your home is worth.

                        <section>Quite often, when buyers would &quot;like&quot; to close is when they need to
                        close. Knowledge of their deadlines for completing negotiations again creates a
                        negotiating advantage for you.

                        <section>Beware of closing on your new home while you're still making mortgage
                        payments on the old one or you might end up becoming a seller who is eager (even
                        desperate) for the first deal that comes along.

                        <section>It has been proven that it's more difficult to sell a home that is vacant
                        because it becomes forlorn looking, forgotten, no longer an appealing sight.
                        Buyers start getting the message that you have a another home and are probably
                        motivated to sell. This could cost you thousands of dollars.

                        <section>Don't try to sell by a certain date. This adds unnecessary pressure and is a
                        serious disadvantage in negotiations.

                        <section>Invariably the initial offer&nbsp;is below what both you and the buyer&nbsp;knows he'll
                        pay for your property. Don't be upset, evaluate the offer&nbsp;objectively. Ensure it
                        spells out the offering price, sufficient deposit, amount of down payment,
                        mortgage amount, a closing&nbsp;date and any special requests. This can simply
                        provide a starting point from which you can negotiate. 
                        </section>
                        <section><h3>24. Turn That Low Offer&nbsp;Around</h3></section>
                        <section>You can counter a low offer&nbsp;or even an offer&nbsp;that's just under your asking
                        price. This lets the buyer&nbsp;know that the first offer&nbsp;isn't seen as being a
                        serious one. Now you'll be negotiating only with buyers with serious offers.

                        <section><h3>25. Maybe the Buyer's Not Qualified</h3></section>
                        <section>If you feel an offer&nbsp;is inadequate, now is the time to make sure the buyer&nbsp;is
                        qualified to carry the size of mortgage&nbsp;the deal requires. Inquire how they
                        arrived at their figure, and suggest they compare your price&nbsp;to the prices of
                        homes for sale in your neighborhood.

                        <section><h3>26. Ensure the Contract&nbsp;is Complete</h3></section>
                        <section>To avoid problems, ensure that all terms, costs and responsibilities are
                        spelled out in the contract of sale. It should include such items as the date it
                        was made, names of parties involved, address of property being sold, purchase
                        price, where deposit monies will be held, date for loan approval, date and place
                        of closing, type of deed, including any contingencies that remain to be settled
                        and what personal property is included (or not) in the sale.

                        <section><h3>27. Resist Deviating From the Contract</h3></section>
                        <section>For example, if the buyer&nbsp;requests a move-in prior to closing, just say no and
                        that you've been advised against it. Now is not the time to take any chances of the deal falling through.
