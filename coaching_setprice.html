<h2>Pricing Your Home</h2>

<p>When you decide to sell your home, setting your asking price is one of the most important decisions you will ever make. Depending on how a buyer is made aware of your home, price is often the first thing he or she sees, and many homes are discarded by prospective buyers as not being in the appropriate price range before they're even give a chance of a showing. 
</p>
<p>
  <b>Your asking price is often your home's "first impression", and if you want to realize the most money you can for your home, it's imperative that you make a good first impression</b>. 
</p>
<p>This is not as easy as it sounds, and pricing strategy should not be taken lightly. Pricing too high can be as costly to a homeseller as pricing too low. Taking a look at what homes in your neighbourhood have sold for is only a small part of the process, and on it's own is not nearly enough to help you make the best decision.
