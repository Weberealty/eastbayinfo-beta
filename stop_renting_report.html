                    payment. Goodness knows that you must meet this monthly obligation every 30 days
                    already. The problem is accumulating enough capital to make a down payment on
                    something more permanent.

                    <section>There are some local or federal government programs (such as 1st time buyer
                    programs) to help people get into the housing market. You can qualify as a first
                    time buyer even if your spouse has owned a home before as long as your name was
                    not registered. Ensure your real estate agent is informed and knowledgeable in
                    this important area and can offer&nbsp;programs to help you with your options.

                    closing costs</h3>
                    </section>
                    <section>Even if you do not have enough cash for a down payment, if you are debt free,
                    and own an asset free and clear (such as a car for example), your lending
                    institution may be able to lend you the down payment&nbsp;for your home by securing
                    it against this asset. 
                    </section>
                    <section><h3>3. You may be able to find a seller&nbsp;to help you buy and finance your home </h3></section>
                    <section>Some sellers may be willing to hold a second mortgage for you as a seller
                    take-back. In this case, the seller becomes your lending institution. Instead
                    of paying this seller&nbsp;a lump sum full amount for his or her home, you would pay
                    monthly mortgage&nbsp;installments.

                    <section>By borrowing money for certain investments to a specified level, you may be
                    able to generate a significant tax refund for yourself that you can use as a
                    down payment. While the money borrowed for these investments is technically a
                    loan, the monthly amount paid can be small, and the money invested in both home
                    and investment will be yours in the end.

                    <section>If you can come up with more than the minimum down payment, or can secure the
                    loan with other equity, many lending institutions will consider you for a
                    mortgage. Alternatively, a seller&nbsp;take-back mortgage&nbsp;could also help you in this
                    situation.

                    <section><h3>6. You can, and should, get pre-approved for a home loan before you go
                    looking for a home</h3>
                    </section>
                    <section>Pre-approval is easy, and can give you complete peace-of-mind when shopping
                    for your home. Mortgage&nbsp;experts can obtain written pre-approval for you at no
                    cost and no obligation, and it can all be done quite easily over-the-phone. More
                    than just a verbal approval from your lending institution, a written
                    pre-approval is as good as money in the bank. It entails a completed credit
                    application, and a certificate which guarantees you a mortgage&nbsp;to the specified
                    level when you find the home you're looking for. Consider dealing only with a
                    professional who specializes in mortgages. Enlisting their services can make the
                    difference between obtaining a mortgage, and being stuck in the renter's rut
                    forever. Typically there is no cost or obligation to enquire.
