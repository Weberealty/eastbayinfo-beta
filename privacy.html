          <br />
          <span>Personal information is generally any information about an identifiable person
            other than the name, title or business address or telephone number of an employee
            of an organization, provided that such business contact information is used only
            to contact the employee in their business or professional capacity. </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong><a name="How_do_the"></a><span>How do the Agent/Broker Sites collect personal
            information from you?</span></strong><br />
          <br />
          <span>We collect personal information from you only for the purposes we identify to
            you at or prior to the time we collect such personal information. We do not require
            this information in order for you to obtain access, to surf or to view the content
            on the Agent/Broker Sites. </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          <span>For those few activities on our Sites where the collection of personal information
            is necessary (for example, when you contact us with a question or a request), you
            will know because the purposes for which your personal information is to be used
            will be identified to you. For those activities, we may collect, for example, your
            name, street address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address and postal code.
            When you complete a loan or realty request at an Agent/Broker Site, it may be necessary
            for us to supplement the information you provide with information from third party
            sources. We will not collect more information than is necessary. </span>
          <br />

          <strong><a name="Does_Agent"></a><span>Does Agent/Broker collect or use information
            collected from you with technology?</span></strong><br />
          <br />
          <span>The Agent/Broker Sites collect some information about you using technology,
            so it may not be readily apparent to you that it is being collected. For instance,
            when you come to our Sites, your IP address may be collected so that we know how
            many visits we have had by separate individuals. An IP address is often associated
            with the place from which you enter the Internet like your Internet Service Provider
            (ISP) or your firm or company. This information is not personally identifiable.

          <strong><a name="How_does_Agent"></a><span>How does Agent/Broker use the personal
            information it has collected from you?</span></strong><br />
          <br />
          <span>We collect and use personal information to respond to your questions or comments,
            to send out information on our real estate or mortgage services or our company,
            to promote the products or services of other third party suppliers to Agent/Broker,
            to administer certain services as identified to you at the time of collection, to
            refer you (with your consent) to another agent or broker if there is a service that
            we cannot provide for you. We will also use such information for statistical and
            marketing analyses, in a form where the information is no longer identifiable with
            you. </span>

            disclose such information, other than as follows: </span>

              technology support; (ii) submitting and processing your loan, realty or other related

          </ol>
          <span>We will let you know at the time the information is collected if such third-party
            sharing is anticipated, will identify the types of businesses at the area of collection,
            will describe the information we will share (like your mail or e-mail address) and
            will only share data if you agree. We recommend that you contact such other parties
            directly for more information about their privacy policies.

            <br />
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may also (a) make disclosures of personal information
            to a potential acquiror in connection with a transaction involving the sale of our
            business, and (b) send personal information outside of the country for the purposes
            set out above, including for process and storage by service providers in connection
            with such purposes, and you should note that while such information is out of the
            country, it is subject to the laws of the country in which it is held, and may be
            subject to disclosure to the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory
            agencies of such other country, pursuant to the laws of such country. </span>
